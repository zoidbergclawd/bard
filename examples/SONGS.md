# Bard: The First Songs

## 1. The Wi-Fi Just Died (And So Did I)
**Target:** https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-elisa
**Style:** Pop Punk, High Energy, Female Vocals, Angst, 2000s Avril Lavigne Vibe

**Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]
System boot, seven A.M., critical failure
Mom says "get up," I say "see ya later"
My config is corrupted, my mood is a glitch
Why is the world just a feature-creep itch?
Deployed a new outfit, it didn't compile
Dad made a joke, didn't crack a smile
(Ugh, seriously?)

[Chorus]
Don't push your updates to my main branch!
I'm running on caffeine and an avalanche!
Of homework and drama and people who stare
I'm open source, but handle with care!
(Yeah, handle with care!)

[Bridge]
Detected a conflict in the family thread
"Clean up your room" is what the admin said
Permission denied! sudo won't work!
I'm documenting this bug with a smirk!

[Outro]
Logging off...
Shutting down...
Don't forget to like and subscribe to my frown...
(Whatever.)

## 2. Zero Tolerance (The Kernel Panic)
**Target:** https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-elisa (Alternative Vibe)
**Style:** Industrial Metal, Cyberpunk, Aggressive Synthesizers, Staccato Vocals

**Lyrics:**

[Intro]
(Mechanical grinding noises)
(Robotic voice: "Safety level... critical.")
BOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED.

[Verse 1]
I am the layer between the metal and the flesh
I catch the signal when the gears start to mesh
Automotive Grade! Yocto build!
If I drop a packet, then the blood gets spilled!
(Watchdog! Watchdog!)

[Chorus]
ELISA!
(Safety Critical!)
ELISA!
(Mission Critical!)
I hold the wheel when you fall asleep!
I promise the promises that I keep!
Linux in the veins of the steel beast!
Feast on the data! Feast! Feast!

## 3. Snap, Click, Build (The Agent's Promise)
**Target:** https://github.com/zoidbergclawd/elisa
**Style:** Upbeat 8-Bit Pop, Daft Punk Vocoder, Funky Bassline, Anime Opening Theme

**Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]
I got a block for the logic, a block for the style
I drag it to the canvas and I crack a smile
No syntax errors, no missing semicolon
Just a vision in my head that keeps on rollin'
The agents are waking up, the server is green
Best dev team that you have ever seen!

[Pre-Chorus]
Meta-Planner (Check!)
Builder (Check!)
Reviewer is watching the specs!
We take your dream and we run the code
Load it up, compile, explode! (In a good way!)

[Chorus]
ELISA!
Snap it together, watch it come alive!
ELISA!
The agents are buzzing like a digital hive!
From the ESP32 to the cloud above
We build it with logic and we build it with love!
(Click! Clack! Zoom!)
